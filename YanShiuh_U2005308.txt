My name is Kee Yan Shiuh with matrix number, U2005308/1. I am 
majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the 
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling exciting about taking this 
subject. This is because DS is a quite challenging subject, more accurate should called skill. Although it is hard, but it is a basic for everyone to become anSoftware Engineer. 
I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad. So, I 
think I can manage to get A/A+ for this DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will always revise what lecturer had taughtand keep doing extra exercises to gain more experiences. Wish me luck!!!
