Characteristics of each type of collection:

1. List
- stores elements by insertion order (end / specific position)
- allow adding, retrieving, modifying, removing elements by index
- allow null & duplicate elements
- 2 implementations
  i. ArrayList
  ii. LinkedList

2. Map
- not a true collection as it doesn't extend Collection interface
- cannot contain duplicate keys
- each key can only map to at most one value
- some allow null key and null value(HashMap & LinkedListMap) but some does not(TreeMap)
- due to it is not a collection, so we have to iterate map using collection view
  For exmaple: turn Map to Set / iterate over values
- non thread-safe, so have to synchronize Map
- 3 implementations
  i. HashMap 
     - use when order does not matter and nulss are acceptable
     - does not impose any order on its key-value elements.
  ii. LinkedHashMap - use when want a Map with its key-value pairs are sorted by insertion order
  iii. TreeMap - use when want a Map sorts its key-value pairs by natural order of keys or custom order

3. Queue / Deque
- allow duplicate elements


4. Set
- duplication is not allowed
- elements are not stored in order
- use when want to store elements distinctly without duplication
  and don't care about the order of elements
- Implementation
   i. HashSet
   - no duplication & no order
   - use when ordering doesn't matter
   ii. LinkedHashSet
   - order the elements based on insertion order
   - use when want to store unique elements in order
   iii. TreeSet
   - order the elements based on the values or natural ordering
   - use when want to order elements by values
