The output is
(1)	Performs Person's tasks
(2)	Invoke Employee's overloaded constructor
(3)	Performs Employee's tasks
(4)	Performs Faculty's tasks

The reasons are
-	Whenever calling a class, Java runtime will run the constructor of the base class first instead of the own constructor.
-	Hence, when calling Faculty class, it will forward to its base class, Employee, then Person class which is the base class of Employee.
