Q3.  What is a raw type? Why is a raw type unsafe? Why is the raw type allowed in Java?
- Raw type is a non-generics class and deals with "raw" Objects
  / a class that without specifying the type argument.
- It will cause runtime error
- It allow legacy code to still compile as raw types are used for backward compatibility.

Q4. What is erasure? Why are Java generics implements using erasure?
- Erasure is the action to erase the generic type information after compilation.
- This approach enables the generic code to be backward compatible with the legacy code that use raw type.
